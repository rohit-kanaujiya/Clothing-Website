Key Features Implemented:

Product Categories:

Men's Clothing: 
                  Includes products like casual shirts, formal shirts, and leather jackets.
                  Women's Clothing: Features products such as summer dresses, denim jackets, and blouses.
                  Accessories: Showcases items like luxury watches, leather belts, and stylish hats.
Shopping Cart:

                  Users can add products to the cart with an "Add to Cart" button.
                  The cart icon in the navigation bar displays the number of items added.
Login System:

                   A simple login modal allows users to log in with preset credentials (username: admin, password: password).
                   Users can log in and log out, with the status retained even on page reload (using localStorage).
Responsive Design:

                   The layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
                   On smaller screens, the product grid adjusts to a vertical layout for a better mobile experience.
                  Basic Styling and Structure:

The design follows a simple and clean aesthetic using CSS for layout and visual elements.
Products are presented in a grid format with images, prices, and descriptions
